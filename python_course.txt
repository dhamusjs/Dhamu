Data Structures:

Data structures are basically just that - they are structures which can hold some data together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data.There are four built-in data structures in Python .

->List
->Tuples and Sequence
->Sets
->Dictionaries
->Looping Techniques

Modules:

A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
